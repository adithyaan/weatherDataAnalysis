# Weather Data Analysis

## Overview

This project efficiently ingests data using multi-threading and implements an autoloader to detect and load files generated by multi-threading. The combination of multi-threading and autoloading ensures optimal performance and fault-tolerance in the data ingestion process.

## Features

- **Multi-Threading:** The project utilizes multi-threading to parallelize the download and extraction of data, improving efficiency and reducing processing time.

- **AutoLoader:** An autoloader mechanism is implemented to automatically detect and load newly generated files. This ensures that the system stays up-to-date with the latest data without manual intervention.

- **Fault-Tolerance:** The autoloader is designed with a fault-tolerance mechanism, allowing it to recover from failures and continue processing data seamlessly.
